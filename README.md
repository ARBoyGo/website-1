## Developing
If you use NixOS, clone the repository, cd into the clone and type ``nix-shell``

If you do not use NixOS, clone the repository, cd into the clone and type in pnpm i. (or just use normal npm, but don't use yarn)

To test your changes, type in pnpm run dev (or again, you can use npm, just don't use yarn)
