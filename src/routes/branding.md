### Now let's get into the branding
We put pretty much everything you need on IPFS. [Click me!](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY3Z13o37oF5sW6mZn28AuYVAxENpsBvsAC1sKPQWKTEW)
In that folder, you will find:
    - projectsegfault1.kra (this is the base design)
    - projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf (this is where we applied the line-arty effect)
    - projectsegfault1.png (this is the Krita export, that is used in projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf)
    - projectsegfault1_gimp.png (this is the final logo)
    - projectsegfault1_wallpaper.png (This is a quickly-made 1080p wallpaper of our logo. It looks rather good!)
