### Now let's get into the branding
We put pretty much everything you need on IPFS. [Click me!](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY3Z13o37oF5sW6mZn28AuYVAxENpsBvsAC1sKPQWKTEW)

In that folder, you will find the following goodies:
    - projectsegfault1.kra (this is the base design)
    - projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf (this is where we applied the line-arty effect)
    - projectsegfault1.png (this is the Krita export, that is used in projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf)
    - projectsegfault1_gimp.png (this is the final logo)
    - projectsegfault1_wallpaper.png (This is a quickly-made 1080p wallpaper of our logo. It looks rather good!)

    <img src={ProjectSegfaultWallpaper} alt="Project Segfault Wallpaper Screenshot on Windows 11" class="ResponsiveImage pointyfinger" width="1600" height="900" onclick="window.open(this.src)">

Odyssey346 designed these logos quickly in GIMP and Krita. FOSS software is good enough for making simple logos like ours.
