## Who is the project owner?
Orinigally: Midou (Sysadmin) and Mrlerien (Hoster) and now Devnol (Sysadmin) is with us.

# Hold on, what if Devnol decides to backstab you?
I highly doubt he will, but in any case this happens, critical services will stay up. So only extra (non important services) running on the server will be gone, but you should be aware of that anyways.

# Your server have toxic people! 
You can contact us by mail or matrix and we'll figure this out.

# How can i trust you?
If you're paranoid, I guess you can use tor, even tho we're not hosting any tor links for reasons (We used to host a tor node but we need that ram now).

# Which ways do you prefer to communicate?
Look at <a href="/contact">Contact</a>.
