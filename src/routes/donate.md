## Our donation methods

# please do
If you donate, we will be more motivated to work on the server and host more stuff and maybe even get more hardware. I really recommend you donate any spare money you have if you enjoyed our services, like if you had so much fun on our Garry's Mod server (cause I've had a lot of fun there)

# yeah sure I'll donate. links?
