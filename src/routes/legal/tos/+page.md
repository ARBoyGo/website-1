## { description }

1. **Do not use** our Services to **(D)DOS** or **attempt to disrupt** someone else's online stability.
2. **Do not use** our Services to **Dox** someone.
3. **Do not do** anything on our Services that would be **illegal** in France.
4. **Refrain** from using our services to **harass** people.
5. While we do try to keep your data safe, you have to acknowledge that **we are not responsible** if anything **unintentional** happens (such as **data loss**, **inability to extract your data** due to the server being down.). It is also **your responsibility** to **keep a backup of your data** if it matters to you.

### Failure to comply will either end up **disabling** your account, and/or if it is illegal, **reporting** to the police.
* Be aware that "**reporting** to the police" only happens if the individual is using our services to **post, promote, or encourage** actions that are **morally unnacceptable**. (Such as: pedophilia, murder, or CSAM.)
* **No warnings will be issued if we find this out.**
