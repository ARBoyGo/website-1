## Legal FAQ

### One of your services contains toxic people!

You can contact us by mail or Matrix and we can figure this out with you. But we recommend that you put most of these requests in our support channel at [#support:projectsegfau.lt](https://matrix.to/#/#support:projectsegfau.lt) on Matrix. If it's something personal, just say that you have a report against someone on one of our services and you'd like to be contacted by an admin and we'll contact you as soon as possible. We generally tend to be active throughout the day.

### How can I trust your services?

Well, you really can't. We don't make our logs or anything else public, however, if you would like access to the data we have on you, please contact us. If you're extremely privacy/security conscious, we have an onion link available on the [Instances](https://projectsegfau.lt/instances) page, and a .onion redirect if you're using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/).
