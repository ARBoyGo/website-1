# Yeah, we have a Minecraft server.
We have an invite-only SMP server running on our network on version 1.18* (1.18, 1.18.1, 1.18.2) which is also bridged to Bedrock using GeyserMC.

If you would like to join, please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/26EG7fFtfS) and ask us there to be whitelisted

## Rules
1. Do not modify buildings without permission.
2. Do not bypass protections. (mining around a protected door, bypassing chest locks etc)
3. Do not cheat
4. Do not lag the shit out of the server.

## IP
**Java**: mcsrv.mutahar.rocks:25565

**Bedrock** mcsrv.mutahar.rocks:19132

*psst, you can join bedrock on your switch using the app we've linked below!*

*another psst, if you play on both Java and Bedrock, [link your accounts together on GeyserMC's website!](https://link.geysermc.org)* Your accounts will be linked together meaning you will have the exact same experience.
