# Yeah, we have a Minecraft server.
We have an invite-only SMP server running on our network on version 1.18.2.

1. Do not modify buildings without permission.
2. Do not bypass protections. (mining around a protected door, bypassing chest locks etc)
3. Do not cheat
4. Do not lag the shit out of the server.
